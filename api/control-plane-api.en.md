# Control Plane API Reference

This document describes the HTTP endpoints currently implemented by the Control Plane, including request parameters, response structures, and directly executable `curl` commands for testing.

> **API-first design**: All Control Plane capabilities are exposed through the REST API as the primary interface. The Web administration interface (WebUI) itself is just one client of this API, equal to any third-party system or automation script. The guiding principle: **Everything faces the Control Plane**. Third-party integrations always call the Control Plane API and never bypass it to operate directly on an Agent or the data plane.

The Control Plane is a persistent HTTP service running on the Controller node, responsible for:

- Adding Workers
- Removing Workers
- Querying Worker inventory
- Querying Agent status
- Maintaining `dnsmasq/dhcp-hosts.conf`
- Calling Agents to create or delete iSCSI LUNs

It does **not** generate iPXE menus, serve static files, or directly operate `tgtadm`/`targetcli`.

## 1. General Information

### 1.1 Base URL

Local example:

```text
http://localhost:4839
```

Replace with the actual address if you expose it on a different port or domain.

### 1.2 Environment File

The container reads environment variables through the Compose file:

```yaml
env_file:
  - ./control_plane/control_plane.env
```

The Control Plane code does **not** parse a `.env` file directly; it reads container environment variables via `os.getenv(...)`.

### 1.3 Authentication

If the environment variable `IPXE_CP_TOKEN` is empty, the Control Plane does **not** require authentication.  
If `IPXE_CP_TOKEN` is set, **all** endpoints except `GET /healthz` must include:

```http
Authorization: Bearer <IPXE_CP_TOKEN>
```

Example:

```bash
export BASE_URL=http://localhost:4839
export TOKEN=replace-me
```

curl with authentication:

```bash
curl -s "$BASE_URL/workers" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

## 2. Files Are the Source of Truth

The current Control Plane state files are divided as follows:

| File | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `config/agents.yml` | Agent node inventory and scheduling roles |
| `state/workers.yml` | Worker storage inventory |
| `state/masters.yml` | Master tag ledger (os / os_version annotations, see 6.4) |
| `dnsmasq/dhcp-hosts.conf` | Single source of truth for `MAC -> hostname` bindings |
| `state/operations.jsonl` | Control Plane operation audit trail |

Notes:

- `workers.yml` does **not** store MAC addresses.
- In the Compose file, mount the entire `dnsmasq` directory into the container, not just the single `dhcp-hosts.conf` file. The Control Plane performs an atomic replace using a temporary file when writing.
- `dnsmasq/dhcp-hosts.conf` contains one binding per line, with a fixed format:

```text
00:0c:29:b9:8b:2d,worker-01
```

```

---

## 5. GET /boot-vars

### Description

Provides per-worker boot variables for iPXE boot scripts. This endpoint does not require authentication and only exposes variables needed for booting within a controlled network.

> **Note**: This endpoint is **read-only** (a projection of boot variables, no write side effects). Registration-window enrollment (new MACs entering the device pool with a public key) has been consolidated into `GET /devices/report` (see 16.6), which `boot.ipxe.cfg` chains **before** `/boot-vars`.

The Control Plane identifies the device and projects boot variables in the following order:

1. `hostname` → `state/workers.yml` (by hostname or worker_id)
2. `mac` → `state/devices.yml` (device inventory) → `bound_worker_id` → `state/workers.yml`
3. `config/agents.yml` (data-plane address of the default boot disk’s Agent)

Then returns the corresponding iSCSI server, default menu item, and menu timeout for that Worker.

By default, it returns an iPXE script snippet for maximum compatibility, which can be executed directly by iPXE’s `chain`. Add `format=json` to receive JSON (useful for manual debugging).

### Field Origins

The response of `/boot-vars` is a projection of the inventory:

| Response Field | Origin |
|---|---|
| `base_nqn` | The prefix of the default boot disk NQN (same disk selection rule) — C3 assembly: the disk NQN is generated by the control plane from the uniform template `base:worker_id.os.<os_tag>`, consumed by the firmware as `sanboot nvme://<ip>:4420/${base-nqn}:<worker>.<os>.<os-tag>` (re-assembled by the firmware = the authoritative disk-record value). Not returned when the disk record lacks `nqn` (no derivation — legacy environments are not supported) or when the Worker has no system disk. |
| `base_iqn` | The IQN of the Worker’s default boot disk (the disk for `default_disk`; if not set, the first disk) with the last colon-and-following part stripped — the disk NQN is the authoritative identifier, the IQN is derived from it. **Not returned** if the Worker has no system disk (iPXE falls back to the static default in `boot.ipxe.cfg`). |
| `storager_ip` | The `storager_ip` of the Agent that hosts the default boot disk (same disk selection rule as above) — the data-plane address shared by NVMe-oF boot and the iSCSI installers. Not returned when there is no system disk. |
| `iscsi_sep` | The iSCSI root **separator** (the part between `${storager-ip}` and `${base-iqn}`, consumed by the installer iSCSI assembly). The root-path assembly is done on the iPXE side. **Returned for stgt / LIO backends only**: `:::1:` for stgt backends (lun placeholder 1), `::::` for LIO backends (empty placeholder). The backend type is determined first from the Agent’s `tags` in `agents.yml` (the presence of `nvmet`/`lio`/`stgt`), then by querying the Agent’s `/capabilities` `backend` field, and finally defaulting to stgt format if the query fails. **Not sent for nvmet backends** (the menu installer items are guarded by `isset ${iscsi-sep}` and skipped). Not returned when there is no system disk. |
| `nbft_secret` | The Worker’s NVMe-oF authentication key (DHHC-1, `state/credentials.yml` indexed by worker_id, see 7.7). **Injected when the Worker is bound and has a key entry**; not returned when there is no key / the Worker is unbound / the request is denied. Consumed by the firmware as `nvme://...?secret=${nbft-secret}` (C3 enabled: conditional assembly in the menu, plaintext connection when no key) |
| `hostnqn` | The Worker’s initiator Host NQN (`KURRENT_CP_NQN_BASE` + `:host.<worker_id>`, matching the host entry registered in nvmet-host); **injected when the Worker is bound**. Consumed by the firmware: iPXE nvmetcp defaults hostnqn to `nqn.2014-08.org.ipxe:<uuid>` (falling back to `:ipxe` without a UUID); a mismatch against the registered value fails strict-mode authentication, so it must be overridden with this field (firmware patch 0011 supports the `hostnqn` setting) |
| `os` | The OS name of the Worker’s default boot disk (the disk for `default_disk`; if not set, the first disk; the disk record is authoritative) — 2026-08-30 MAIN MENU dynamicization: the menu keeps a single generic OS item (`boot-os`), the firmware assembles `nvme://...:${hostname}.${os}` with this variable, so adding a supported OS requires no script changes. Same origin as the disk NQN suffix. Not returned when the Worker has no system disk (reboot loop waits for disk creation). |
| `os_version` | Version annotation of the default boot disk (disk record `os_version`; `''` = no version) — omitted when empty; the `os-label` assembly in menu.ipxe adapts (shows `os version` when present). Not returned when the Worker has no system disk. |
| `os_tag` | Random identifier of the default boot disk (disk record `os_tag`, 12 hex chars, data-plane unique key) — the firmware assembles the disk NQN suffix `${hostname}.${os}.${os-tag}` (same origin and value as the disk NQN). Not returned when the Worker has no system disk. |
| `menu_default` | Derived chain: `workers.yml` `default_disk` (set separately after disk creation; os_tag references a specific disk) > `boot.menu_default` (explicit configuration) > `reboot` (loop reboot waiting when not configured). 2026-08-30 dynamicization: since the menu OS item has converged to the single generic item `boot-os`, any OS-semantics default (`default_disk`, or legacy OS names in `boot.menu_default`) is normalized to `boot-os`; non-OS navigation values (`menu-diag` / `menu-install` / `config` / `shell` / `reboot` / `exit`) are returned as-is |
| `menu_timeout` | When a default boot is configured: `boot.menu_timeout` > `IPXE_CP_BOOT_MENU_TIMEOUT` (default 5000). When in `reboot` loop: always uses `IPXE_CP_AUTO_BOOT_TIMEOUT` (default 1). Units are milliseconds. |

Worker lookup rules (**hostname takes precedence**):

```text
hostname -> workers.yml (by hostname or worker_id)
hostname miss or not provided -> mac -> devices.yml (device inventory) -> bound_worker_id -> workers.yml
not identified and mac provided ->
  - device in pool (pooled) -> reboot loop (menu-default=reboot + short timeout), waiting for binding
  - device revoked -> empty script (menu stays)
  - unknown MAC + registration window open with a valid public key -> enter the device pool (see “Registration-Window Enrollment” below), return reboot loop
  - unknown MAC + window closed / no public key -> empty script (menu stays; report only records the fingerprint, no pool entry)
```

### Default Boot Item Rules

The default boot item is derived by `/boot-vars` in the following order:

```text
default_disk (set separately after disk creation, see 7.3) -> boot.menu_default (explicit config) -> reboot (not configured)
```

- Recommended approach: after creating a system disk, call `PUT /workers/{worker_id}/default-disk` to set the default boot disk (os_tag references a specific disk):
  ```text
  disk=<os_tag> -> menu_default=boot-os, os=<disk os>, os-version=<disk os_version if any>, os-tag=<disk os_tag>
  ```
  Since 2026-08-30, the MAIN MENU keeps a single generic OS item: `menu_default` is normalized to `boot-os` (legacy OS names in `boot.menu_default` are also normalized), and `os` / `os-version` / `os-tag` carry the disk identity consumed by the generic item.
- Alternatively, you can leave `default_disk` unset and use `boot.menu_default` to specify a default item on the iPXE menu (e.g., `menu-install` during installation, or `exit`).
- When neither is configured, `menu_default` returns `reboot` (a short-timeout reboot loop waiting for the admin to create a disk / set a default disk; `exit` is only used when explicitly configured).

### Registration-Window Enrollment (Zero-touch Provisioning)

When a new device boots without an identity, iPXE first `chain`s `/devices/report` (11-field report plus optional `pubkey`, see 16.6) and then requests `/boot-vars`. **Enrollment only happens during the registration window** (2026-08-21 ruling): only when the window is open and the report carries a valid ECDSA P-256 public key does an unknown MAC enter the device pool; once the window closes, reports only update the fingerprint without pool entry (there is no enrollment channel outside the window, and a permanent window cannot be configured at the code level).

1. `GET /devices/report`: unknown MAC + window open + `pubkey` present → written to `state/devices.yml` (`state=pooled`, fingerprint stored, `key_hash` filled, `source=ipxe`)
2. `GET /boot-vars`: MAC in the pool and unbound → returns `menu-default=reboot` + short timeout, rebooting in a loop until the admin binds it
3. After the admin binds the device to a Worker (WebUI / API; single bind 16.7, batch bind preview/execution 16.9/16.10), the next boot follows the Worker configuration normally

Key claim for existing devices: an already-pooled device reporting with a public key during the window gets its `key_hash` filled in (claim complete); a key mismatch is rejected (revoke/re-register by deleting the inventory entry). After all devices have claimed their keys, enable signature enforcement (see 5.1).

Controls:

| Item | Default | Description |
|---|---:|---|
| Registration window | Closed | Open it with `POST /settings/registration-window` during deployment (TTL hard cap 1-60 min, auto-closes on expiry), see 5.1 |
| Signature enforcement | Off | `GET/PUT /settings/enforcement`: when on, `/boot-vars` is only served to bound devices that pass signature verification, see 5.1 |
| `IPXE_CP_AUTO_BOOT_TIMEOUT` | `1` | Menu timeout in milliseconds during the reboot loop. |

The entire enrollment process is logged as operations (`device.register` / `device.claim`). On failure, the inventory is rolled back and an empty script is returned, so the next request will retry without affecting the iPXE boot process.

### Anti-Impersonation (Binding as Authentication)

When a request carries a `mac`, the Control Plane verifies that the device is **bound to the Worker matched by the hostname** (`bound_worker_id`); if not (device bound to another Worker / unbound / unknown), the request is **denied** — an empty script is returned and the boot vars are not leaked. Requests without a `mac` (hostname only) cannot be verified and remain allowed for compatibility. This makes the device↔Worker binding the boot-time authentication boundary: only the bound device can receive the Worker's boot configuration (e.g., `base_nqn` / `storager_ip`).

### Query Parameters

| Parameter | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---:|---|---|
| `mac` | No | None | MAC address. The backend normalizes it by stripping `:` / `-` / `.`. Both colon-separated (`00:0c:29:b9:8b:2d`) and `mac:hexraw` (`000c29b98b2d`) formats are supported. |
| `hostname` | No | None | Hostname, e.g., `worker-01`. |
| `format` | No | `ipxe` | `ipxe` or `json`. |
| `nonce` | No | None | One-time challenge-response nonce (issued by `/devices/challenge`, see 5.2); when enforcement is on, missing → `missing_sig` rejected |
| `sig` | No | None | ECDSA P-256 signature as base64(DER) over `nonce‖mac‖hostname` (no separator, see 5.2); when enforcement is on, missing → `missing_sig` rejected. **Compatibility restore**: iPXE builds URLs without percent-encoding, so the `+` of base64 enters the query verbatim and is decoded as a space under form-urlencoded rules; the server restores spaces to `+` before verifying |

It is recommended to pass at least one of `mac` or `hostname`. From iPXE, it is best to pass both:

```text
/boot-vars?mac=${mac}&hostname=${hostname}
```

> **Note**: Although `${mac:hexraw}` is technically equivalent to `${mac}` (both are normalized), some real iPXE firmware expands the `hexraw` modifier incorrectly (possibly empty). In practice, you must use colon-separated `${mac}` — do not change it back to `hexraw`.

### curl (iPXE Format)

```bash
curl -s "$BASE_URL/boot-vars?mac=000c29b98b2d&hostname=worker-01"
```

Example success response:

```ipxe
#!ipxe
# boot vars for worker-01
set base-nqn nqn.2026-07.com.kurrent
set base-iqn iqn.2026-07.com.kurrent
set storager-ip 192.168.80.3
set iscsi-sep :::1:
set menu-default boot-os
set menu-timeout 5000
set os ubuntu
set nbft-secret DHHC-1:01:<base64>   # only when NVMe-oF authentication is enabled (see 7.7)
set hostnqn nqn.2026-07.com.kurrent:host.worker-01
```

Registered but no default boot configured (no system disk / no `default_disk` / no explicit `boot.menu_default`):

```ipxe
#!ipxe
# boot vars for worker-01
set menu-default reboot
set menu-timeout 1
```

New MAC (window enrollment) or completely unrecognized, and if the window is closed or no public key is carried, returns an empty script:

```ipxe
#!ipxe
# no per-worker boot vars found
```

### curl (JSON Format)

```bash
curl -s "$BASE_URL/boot-vars?mac=000c29b98b2d&hostname=worker-01&format=json"
```

Example success response:

```json
{
  "base_nqn": "nqn.2026-07.com.kurrent",
  "base_iqn": "iqn.2026-07.com.kurrent",
  "storager_ip": "192.168.80.3",
  "iscsi_sep": ":::1:",
  "menu_default": "ubuntu",
  "menu_timeout": 5000,
  "nbft_secret": "DHHC-1:01:<base64>",
  "hostnqn": "nqn.2026-07.com.kurrent:host.worker-01"
}
```

Registered but no default boot configured:

```json
{
  "menu_default": "reboot",
  "menu_timeout": 1
}
```

Unrecognized and not enrolled (window closed / no public key):

```json
{}
```

### iPXE Integration

In `tftp/boot.ipxe.cfg`, the trust chain fetches this endpoint over HTTPS (nginx 443, TOFU anchor) after the challenge-respond handshake (see 5.2):

```ipxe
# Stage 3: challenge-respond (R7) — signed request carries nonce+sig
:challenge
chain --autofree ${https-url}devices/challenge?mac=${mac} && goto signed || goto bootvars

:signed
sign ${nonce}${mac}${hostname} || goto bootvars
chain --autofree ${https-url}boot-vars?mac=${mac}&hostname=${hostname}&nonce=${nonce}&sig=${sig} || goto vars-done
goto vars-done

# Degraded path (challenge failed: not registered/claimed, or legacy firmware):
# served while signature enforcement is off — missing_sig is denied once enforcement is on
:bootvars
chain --autofree ${https-url}boot-vars?mac=${mac}&hostname=${hostname} || goto vars-done

:vars-done
isset ${iscsi-sep} || set iscsi-sep :::1:
isset ${hostname} && set initiator-iqn ${base-iqn}:${hostname} || set initiator-iqn ${base-iqn}:${mac}
```

On success, the returned `base-nqn` / `storager-ip` may override the static defaults; derived variables are re-built at `:vars-done`. The `isset` guard keeps the backend-specific separator (`stgt` `:::1:` / LIO `::::`) projected by `/boot-vars`.

In `menu.ipxe`, the main boot entries assemble the NVMe-oF root-path (`set root-path nvme://${storager-ip}:4420/${base-nqn}:${hostname}.<os>`, with `?secret=` appended when `nbft-secret` is injected via `isset`); the installer entries keep the iSCSI assembly (`set root-path iscsi:${storager-ip}${iscsi-sep}${base-iqn}:${hostname}.<os>`). The protocol prefixes and assembly structure remain static; only the separator is projected from the backend.

### Agent Data-Plane Address

`/boot-vars` returns the **data-plane address** that Workers use to connect to storage (shared by NVMe-oF boot and the iSCSI installers), not the Agent’s HTTP API address. It is recommended to explicitly configure it in `config/agents.yml`:

```yaml
agents:
  storage-lio-01:
    base_url: http://host.docker.internal:4840
    storager_ip: 192.168.80.3
```

If `storager_ip` is not configured, the Control Plane falls back to the host portion of `base_url`. However, when `base_url` is `host.docker.internal`, this value is not suitable for physical Workers.

### 5.1 Registration Window & Enforcement (/settings/registration-window, /settings/enforcement)

#### Description

The registration window is the controlled enrollment channel for the deployment phase (2026-08-21 ruling; it replaces the former `auto-register` permanent switch, whose endpoint has been removed): only while the window is open can new devices report with their public key (`GET /devices/report`) to auto-join the pool and complete key claim; once it closes, reports only record fingerprints without pool entry (no enrollment channel outside the window). The TTL has a hard cap of 60 minutes (a permanent window cannot be configured at the code level) and auto-closes on expiry (lazy computation; query for the actual state). All endpoints require `Authorization: Bearer`.

The signature enforcement switch (transition-period compatibility): when off, keyless devices are served as before (anti-impersonation boundary only); when on, `/boot-vars` applies the 4th injection condition to bound devices — no `key_hash` → rejected as `no_key`; missing `nonce`/`sig` → rejected as `missing_sig`; replay or invalid signature → rejected. Claimed devices carrying an invalid signature are rejected during the transition period as well (forged signatures are never served). It is recommended to turn enforcement on only after all existing devices have completed key claim.

#### GET /settings/registration-window

Queries the registration window status (no record / already expired → `open=false`).

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `open` | bool | Whether the window is open |
| `opened_at` | str | ISO8601 opening time (`null` when closed) |
| `ttl_minutes` | int | TTL in minutes configured when opened (`null` when closed) |
| `closes_at` | str | ISO8601 expected closing time (`null` when closed) |
| `remaining_seconds` | int | Remaining seconds (`0` when closed) |

```json
{"open": true, "opened_at": "2026-08-21T10:00:00+08:00", "ttl_minutes": 30, "closes_at": "2026-08-21T10:30:00+08:00", "remaining_seconds": 1799}
```

#### POST /settings/registration-window

Opens the registration window (status 201). If already open → 409 (close it first); an expired leftover record can be re-opened directly (overwrite). Recorded as an operation (`settings.registration_window`).

**Request body**:

| Field | Required | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ttl_minutes` | Yes | int | 1-60 (returns 400 outside the range) |

```bash
curl -X POST http://<host>:4839/settings/registration-window \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $CP_TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"ttl_minutes": 30}'
```

**Response**: same as GET (window status after opening).

#### DELETE /settings/registration-window

Closes the registration window early (409 when never opened / no record). Recorded as an operation (`settings.registration_window`).

```bash
curl -X DELETE http://<host>:4839/settings/registration-window \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $CP_TOKEN"
```

**Response**: `{"open": false}`

#### GET/PUT /settings/enforcement

Gets/toggles the device signature enforcement switch (persisted to `state/settings.json`, survives restarts).

**Request body (PUT)**:

| Field | Required | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `enabled` | Yes | bool | `true` = enforce (keyless / signature-less devices are denied boot) |

```bash
curl -X PUT http://<host>:4839/settings/enforcement \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $CP_TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"enabled": true}'
```

**Response**: `{"enabled": bool}` (same for GET and PUT). PUT is recorded as an operation (`settings.enforcement`).

### 5.2 GET /devices/challenge

Challenge endpoint (**no auth**): issues a one-time nonce (short TTL, bound to MAC, replay protection; the nonce itself holds no secret) for the `/boot-vars` signature verification chain. Device missing or unclaimed (no `key_hash`) → **404** (cannot take the signature path).

**Query parameters**:

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `mac` | Yes | MAC address (normalization rules same as `/boot-vars`) |

**Success (200, `text/plain`)**: a `#!ipxe` script body — iPXE consumes it directly with `chain`, and `${nonce}` becomes the one-time 64-hex-char nonce afterwards:

```ipxe
#!ipxe
set nonce 0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef
```

**Errors**: `400` (invalid MAC); `404` (device missing/unclaimed).

**Challenge-response chain (with `/boot-vars`, device identity verification)**:

1. `GET /devices/challenge?mac=<mac>` → obtain `${nonce}` by executing the response script
2. iPXE signs `nonce‖mac‖hostname` (UTF-8, no separator; MAC in lowercase colon form) with the device key (ECDSA P-256) → `sig` (base64(DER))
3. `GET /boot-vars?mac=&hostname=&nonce=&sig=` → credentials are served only after verification passes (injection condition #4, see 5.1); verification failure → empty script (deny, audited as `boot_vars.credential`, reasons see 5.1)

## 6. GET /agents

### Description

Lists Agents configured in `config/agents.yml`. By default, it also probes each Agent’s `/healthz` and `/capabilities` in real time.

### Query Parameters

| Parameter | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---:|---|---|
| `live` | No | `true` | Whether to probe Agent status and capabilities in real time. |

### curl

Live probe:

```bash
curl -s "$BASE_URL/agents?live=true" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

Configuration only, no probing:

```bash
curl -s "$BASE_URL/agents?live=false" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

## 6.1 POST /agents

### Description

Registers a new Agent: writes to `config/agents.yml` and takes effect immediately (the Agent will be included in disk creation / mount scheduling). Duplicate `id` registration returns `409`.

**Recommended flow**: first fill in the API address in the WebUI (or use `POST /agents/probe`, see 6.2) and probe to automatically obtain role, tags, data-plane address, etc. After confirming, call this endpoint to complete registration. Direct full-parameter submission is also supported.

### Request Body Fields

| Field | Required | Description |
|---|---:|---|
| `id` | Yes | Agent identifier. Automatically lowercased. Same character rules as worker id (letters, digits, dots, underscores, hyphens). |
| `base_url` | Yes | Agent Control Plane API address. Must start with `http://` or `https://`. Trailing `/` is removed automatically. |
| `storager_ip` | No | Data-plane address (business network IP, protocol-neutral). Falls back to the hostname of `base_url` if omitted. |
| `role` | No | Roles: `disk` = can create system disks (storage node), `cd` = can mount ISOs (optical drive node). Default `{disk: false, cd: false}`. |
| `tags` | No | Free-form tag array (e.g., `storage`/`lio`/`stgt`), for display. The `lio`/`stgt` tags also participate in `/boot-vars` separator derivation. |
| `enabled` | No | Whether the Agent is enabled. Default `true`. |

### curl

## 6.2 POST /agents/probe

### Description

Probes an Agent and auto-derives registration parameters (**read-only preview, no files are written**): calls the Agent’s `/healthz` and `/capabilities` over mTLS (the Control Plane’s client certificate, bound to the internal CA — K8S-style), and derives:

| Parameter | Derivation Rule |
|---|---|
| `role.disk` | Always `true` (Agent is a storage node) |
| `role.cd` | From `capabilities.cd` |
| `tags` | `["storage", backend]` (where `backend` is `lio` or `stgt`; also used for `/boot-vars` separator derivation) |
| `storager_ip` | Falls back to `base_url` hostname if not provided |

### Request Body Fields

| Field | Required | Description |
|---|---:|---|
| `base_url` | Yes | Agent Control Plane API address. Must start with `http://` or `https://`. |
| `agent_id` | No | Agent identifier in edit scenarios (reserved; the probe logic does not currently depend on it). |

### curl

```bash

| `502` | Agent unreachable (`/healthz` failed) or `/capabilities` call failed (e.g., mTLS client certificate not issued by the Control Plane CA) |

---

## 6.3 PUT /agents/{agent_id}

### Description

Updates an existing Agent: overwrites the corresponding entry in `config/agents.yml` and takes effect immediately (disk creation / mount scheduling uses the new configuration). The `id` cannot be changed (taken from the path parameter).

Use cases: iSCSI server configuration changes — data-plane address migration, API address change, disable/enable a node.

### Request Body Fields

| Field | Required | Description |
|---|---:|---|
| `base_url` | Yes | Agent Control Plane API address. Must start with `http://` or `https://`. Trailing `/` is removed automatically. |
| `storager_ip` | No | Data-plane address. Falls back to the hostname of `base_url` if omitted. |
| `role` | No | Roles: `disk` = can create system disks, `cd` = can mount ISOs. Default `{disk: false, cd: false}`. |
| `tags` | No | Free-form tag array. |
| `enabled` | No | Whether the Agent is enabled. `false` disables it (it will no longer participate in disk creation/mount scheduling or liveness probes). Default `true`. |

### curl

> **Probing during edit**: In edit scenarios, it is recommended to first call `POST /agents/probe` (6.2) to verify the new address is reachable before saving. The probe authenticates with the Control Plane’s mTLS client certificate (identity bound to the component CA, K8S-style) — no token is required.

## 6.4 Master Tags (/agents/{agent_id}/masters/{master_name}/tag)

### Overview

Master tags are control-plane annotations (`state/masters.yml`) — `os` / `os_version` are **annotation-only** (for human understanding, no whitelist validation):

- Since 2026-08-30 there is no valid OS set anymore (OS_ITEMS retired): disk creation `os` is a free string, and multiple versions of the same OS are distinguished by the disk-level `os_tag` (a 12-hex random identifier, the data-plane unique key). Master tags only associate a master name with an OS/version.
- **Tagging does not verify that the master exists** (an Agent may be offline; the ledger is authoritative); `/masters` attaches `os` / `os_version` to tagged entries only.
- When creating a disk from a master, the WebUI auto-fills the tag (annotation, editable); clearing a tag only affects future disk creation.

### PUT (register / update)

| Field | Required | Description |
|---|---:|---|
| `os` | Yes | OS annotation (free string, lowercased; for human understanding, not a data-plane identifier) |
| `os_version` | No | Version annotation, defaults to `''` (no version) |

#### curl

```bash
curl -s -X PUT "$BASE_URL/agents/storage-lio-01/masters/_tpl_ubuntu_2204.img/tag" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "os": "ubuntu",
    "os_version": "22.04"
  }'
```

#### Success response

```json
{ "agent": "storage-lio-01", "name": "_tpl_ubuntu_2204.img", "os": "ubuntu", "os_version": "22.04" }
```

### DELETE (clear)

```bash
curl -s -X DELETE "$BASE_URL/agents/storage-lio-01/masters/_tpl_ubuntu_2204.img/tag" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

Returns `{ "agent": ..., "name": ..., "removed": true|false }` (`removed=false` = there was no tag to begin with).

### Error Responses

| Status Code | Scenario |
|---:|---|
| `400` | `os` empty / illegal characters; `os_version` contains illegal characters |
| `401` | Missing or invalid Token |
| `404` | Agent not found |

## 6.5 One-Command Join: bootstrap token issuance + enroll auto-registration

### Description

K8S-homomorphic (`kubeadm join`): the control plane issues a one-time bootstrap token (`<6-hex>.<16-hex>`, only the sha256 hash is stored, 7-day TTL); the node carries it in `Authorization: Bearer` during enrollment and the token is burned once enrollment succeeds (subsequent renewals use mTLS, see 6.5.1). **The plaintext is not recoverable**: re-issuing while an unused token exists returns 409 — delete the entry in `state/pki/bootstrap-tokens.yml` and re-issue.

### POST /agents/{agent_id}/bootstrap-token

#### Query parameters

| Field | Required | Description |
|---|---:|---|
| `component` | No | `agent` (default) or `nvmet-host`; the nvmet component requires the agent component to be registered first |

#### curl

```bash
curl -s -X POST "$BASE_URL/agents/storage-lio-01/bootstrap-token?component=agent" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

#### Successful response (201)

```json
{
  "agent_id": "storage-lio-01",
  "component": "agent",
  "token": "a1b2c3.0123456789abcdef",
  "expires_at": "2026-09-07T12:00:00Z",
  "usage": ["enroll"]
}
```

The `token` plaintext is visible only in this response (storage keeps only the sha256 hash); consumption is described in 6.5.2.

#### Common errors

| HTTP status | Common cause |
|---:|---|
| `401` | Missing or wrong token |
| `409` | An unused token already exists for this agent/component (plaintext unrecoverable; delete the entry and re-issue) |
| `422` | Invalid `component` |

### 6.5.1 enroll auto-registration (POST /enroll, nginx entry /api/cp/enroll)

K8S-homomorphic (kubelet auto-registers the Node on first report): when an `agent` component enrolls (`POST /enroll`, Bearer = bootstrap token) and the id is absent from `agents.yml`, the control plane **auto-creates the entry** (role_disk=True, role_cd=False, enabled=True, tags=`("auto",)`) and persists the request’s `base_url` field (agent side `KURRENT_ADVERTISE_URL`, control-plane-reachable address) into the registry. Rules:

- `nvmet-host` components are **not auto-registered** (they share the agent_id; the agent component must be registered first — otherwise 400, container restart retries)
- A non-empty `base_url` must start with `http://` / `https://`, otherwise 400 (no auto-registration)
- An already-registered agent’s `base_url` is not updated by enrollment (`agents.yml` stays authoritative)

### 6.5.2 One-command join (node side)

After issuance, run on the target node from the repository root (auto-writes `.env` + `compose up`, idempotent; use `--dir` to point at the storager directory otherwise):

```bash
# Control plane (issue and print a ready-to-paste join command):
./cli/kurrent nodes token storage-lio-01 --nvmet

# Node (run on storage-01, kubeadm join homomorphic; ./kurrent-join.sh is the equivalent fallback without Go):
./kurrent join https://<cp-host> <token> storage-lio-01 --nvmet-token <nvmet-token>
```

## 6.6 DELETE /agents/{agent_id}

### Description

Removes the Agent’s registry entry (`config/agents.yml`) and cleans up its master tags (`state/masters.yml` entry under masters). **Already-issued certificates and running LUNs are unaffected** (after a container restart, bootstrap fails because the id is unregistered and retries).

### curl

```bash
curl -s -X DELETE "$BASE_URL/agents/storage-lio-01" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

### Successful response

```json
{ "deleted": "storage-lio-01", "master_tags_removed": false }
```

### Common errors

| HTTP status | Common cause |
|---:|---|
| `401` | Missing or wrong token |
| `404` | Agent does not exist |

## 7. POST /workers

### Description

Registers a Worker’s **identity**: hostname binding. **Storage and identity are separated** — this endpoint does not create any system disks. System disks must be created separately via `POST /workers/{worker_id}/luns/disk` (see 7.1). `mac` is now **optional**:

- Without `mac` → a pure idle Worker (hostname binding only; no device authorized). Bind a device later via `POST /devices/{mac}/bind` (16.7).
- With `mac` → the device must exist in the device pool (`state=pooled`); it is validated and bound directly (one-to-one authorization). If the device is out-of-pool or already bound, a `409` is returned — **register first, then bind**.

The Control Plane will:

1. Validate `worker_id`, `hostname`; validate `mac` if provided
2. Write to `state/workers.yml` (`disks` as empty array, `state=registered`)
3. If `mac` is provided: bind the device (write `state/devices.yml` `bound_worker_id` + write to `dnsmasq/dhcp-hosts.conf`)
4. Send a HUP signal to the `ipxe-dnsmasq` container via Docker:

```bash
docker exec ipxe-dnsmasq killall -HUP dnsmasq
```

5. If `windows_iso` is specified, additionally call the Agent to create a CD target (installation optical drive, unrelated to system disks).

### Request Body Fields

| Field | Required | Description |
|---|---:|---|
| `worker_id` | Yes | Worker identifier. Automatically lowercased. Allowed characters: letters, digits, dots, underscores, hyphens. |
| `mac` | No | Worker NIC MAC address, e.g., `00:0c:29:b9:8b:2d`. If provided, the device must already be in the pool (see 16); the device is bound to this Worker in the same call. |
| `hostname` | No | Hostname. Defaults to `worker_id` if not provided. |
| `arch` | No | Architecture. Defaults to `x86_64`. |
| `windows_iso` | No | Windows installation ISO filename. When provided, an installation CD target is created during registration. |
| `boot` | No | iPXE menu default item and timeout configuration. If omitted, `/boot-vars` derives them from the default boot disk and global defaults. Writes to the same ledger fields as the 7.3 `default-disk` endpoint; later calls override earlier ones. |

### `boot` Fields

| Field | Required | Description |
|---|---:|---|
| `menu_default` | No | Default item on the iPXE main menu (auto-selected after the menu times out); valid values in the 7.3 table; case-insensitive, e.g., `ubuntu`, `debian`, `windows`, `exit`. |
| `menu_timeout` | No | iPXE menu timeout in milliseconds, e.g., `5000`; `0` means the menu waits indefinitely and never auto-selects. |

When `boot` is omitted:

- `menu_default` defaults to `default_disk` (set separately after disk creation, see 7.3); if not set, defaults to `reboot` (loop reboot waiting for configuration, see section 5).
- `menu_timeout` defaults to `IPXE_CP_BOOT_MENU_TIMEOUT` (currently `5000`) when a default boot is configured; in the `reboot` loop it is fixed to `IPXE_CP_AUTO_BOOT_TIMEOUT` (currently `1` ms, see section 5).

Therefore, most Workers do not need to pass `boot`. For example:

```json
{
  "worker_id": "worker-01",
  "mac": "00:0c:29:b9:8b:2d"
}
```

After registration, the Worker has no system disk, so `/boot-vars` returns `menu-default reboot` with a 1 ms timeout — the Worker enters a fast reboot loop waiting for the admin to create a disk / set a default boot OS:

```ipxe
set menu-default reboot
set menu-timeout 1
```

After creating a system disk, call `PUT /workers/{worker_id}/default-disk` (see 7.3) to set the default boot disk (os_tag references a specific disk), and `menu-default` will switch to the generic OS item `boot-os`.

Only pass `boot` when you want to override the menu behavior:

```json
{
  "worker_id": "worker-01",
  "mac": "00:0c:29:b9:8b:2d",
  "boot": {
    "menu_default": "exit",
    "menu_timeout": 0
  }
}
```

During Windows installation, if you want to default to the installation menu:

```json
{
  "worker_id": "worker-win-build",
  "mac": "00:0c:29:b9:8b:11",
  "windows_iso": "Win11_24H2.iso",
  "boot": {
    "menu_default": "menu-install",
    "menu_timeout": 3000
  }
}
```

### PUT /workers/{worker_id}/mac (Rebind Mapping)

Changes the Worker’s MAC binding (hostname unchanged). It is mapped internally to a **device rebind**: the new MAC must be in the pool (`state=pooled`) and is bound to this Worker; the old device (if bound to this Worker) is released back to the pool. The audit trail records `device.bind` (new) + `device.unbind` (old) plus the compatibility `worker.mac.update`.

**Request body**: `{"mac": "00:0c:29:b9:8b:2d"}`

**409**: new MAC out-of-pool / revoked / already bound to another Worker; old device bound to an unexpected Worker.

**Idempotent**: setting the same MAC again returns `changed=false`.


## 7.1 POST /workers/{worker_id}/luns/disk

### Description

Creates a system disk LUN for a given Worker. System disks are categorized by (os, os_version); a Worker can have multiple system disks (at most one per OS+version pair; different versions of the same OS can coexist — distinguished by the disk-level `os_tag` random identifier). The Control Plane will:

1. Verify the Worker exists and does not already have a disk for that (os, os_version) (returns `409` if it does).
2. Generate the disk-level random identifier `os_tag` (12 hex chars, the data-plane unique key) — it determines the disk NQN suffix and filename.
3. Select a storage Agent (specified by `disk_agent` or auto-selected).
4. Assemble the disk NQN (`base-nqn:worker-id.os.<os_tag>`) and backing filename (`worker-id.os.<os_tag>.img`).
5. Call the Agent to create the disk target (master clone or empty disk).
6. Update the Worker’s `disks` inventory in `state/workers.yml` (append to array). On the first disk creation, `state` transitions from `registered` to `ready`.

This endpoint resides under the `/luns/` namespace to reserve space for future data disks (`/luns/data`). In a multi-disk scenario, the default boot disk is determined by the `disk` (os_tag) parameter of `PUT /workers/{worker_id}/default-disk`.

### Path Parameters

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|---|---:|---|
| `worker_id` | Yes | Worker identifier. |

### Request Body Fields

| Field | Required | Description |
|---|---:|---|
| `type` | Yes | `master` or `empty`. |
| `name` | Conditionally required | Required when `type=master`. The master image filename. |
| `size` | Conditionally required | Required when `type=empty`. The empty disk size, e.g., `40G`. |
| `os` | Yes | OS annotation (for human understanding; determines the os segment in the disk NQN/filename). Free string, lowercased, **no whitelist validation** (OS_ITEMS retired 2026-08-30). |
| `os_version` | No | Version annotation (`''` = no version, the default). At most one disk per (os, os_version); different versions can coexist. |
| `disk_agent` | No | Specify a storage Agent. If omitted, the Control Plane auto-selects one. |

### 7.1.3 Batch Create System Disks (POST /workers/luns/disk/batch)

Batch deployment scenario: apply the same disk parameters to multiple Workers, each using its pre-assigned storage node (`targets[].agent` is required — it is generated by the WebUI’s “take over selected Workers” or drag-and-drop assignment; there is no common automatic allocation).

Same as single-disk creation: `master` clones from a master image, `empty` creates a blank disk. At most one disk per (os, os_version) is allowed; if a Worker already has one it is **automatically skipped** (not considered a failure). **Successfully created Workers automatically set `default_disk` to the batch disk’s `os_tag`** — batch deployment goes directly to the default boot without needing an extra `PUT /workers/{worker_id}/default-disk` call (single-disk creation does NOT set this automatically). Each item is processed independently; a failure of one does not affect the others. Returns a summary of `succeeded` / `skipped` / `failed`.

#### Request Body Fields

| Field | Required | Description |
|---|---:|---|
| `type` | Yes | `master` or `empty`. |
| `os` | Yes | OS annotation (same for all Workers in the batch; determines the os segment in the disk NQN/filename; free string, no whitelist validation). |
| `os_version` | No | Version annotation (`''` = no version, the default). |
| `name` | Conditionally required | Required when `type=master`. The master image filename. |
| `size` | Conditionally required | Required when `type=empty`. The empty disk size, e.g., `40G`. |
| `targets` | Yes | Array of `{worker_id, agent}`: the Worker identifier and its assigned storage node. |

## 7.2 Windows Installation: Identity Registration + ISO + System Disk

Windows installation is a two-step process: first register the identity (optionally specifying the installation ISO), then create the system disk.

### 7.2.1 Identity Registration (with ISO)

```bash
curl -s -X POST "$BASE_URL/workers" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "worker_id": "worker-win-build",
    "mac": "00:0c:29:b9:8b:11",
    "windows_iso": "Win11_24H2.iso"
  }'
```

After registration, the response has `state=installing` (a CD target exists) and `disks` as an empty array.

### 7.2.2 Create System Disk

```bash
curl -s -X POST "$BASE_URL/workers/worker-win-build/luns/disk" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "type": "empty",
    "os": "windows",
    "size": "80G"
  }'
```

Response after creation:

```json
{
  "hostname": "worker-win-build",
  "arch": "x86_64",
  "state": "installing",
  "disks": [
    {
      "agent": "storage-lio-01",
      "iqn": "iqn.2026-07.com.controller:worker-win-build.windows.9b8a7c6d5e4f",

      "backing": "/home/iscsi_img/worker-win-build.windows.9b8a7c6d5e4f.img",
      "os": "windows",
      "os_version": "",
      "os_tag": "9b8a7c6d5e4f",
      "source": {
        "type": "empty",
        "size": "80G"
      }
    }
  ],
  "cd": {
    "agent": "controller-stgt",
    "iqn": "iqn.2026-07.com.controller:worker-win-build.windows.iso",
    "iso": "Win11_24H2.iso",

  },
  "worker_id": "worker-win-build",
  "mac": "00:0c:29:b9:8b:11"
}
```

After installation finishes, the CD target is cleaned up as part of the Worker deletion flow.

### Common Errors

| HTTP Status | Common Causes |
|---:|---|
| `400` | Parameter format error; `os` empty or illegal characters; `type=master` but `name` missing; `type=empty` but `size` missing |
| `401` | Missing or incorrect Token |
| `404` | Worker not found when creating a system disk |
| `409` | `worker_id` already exists; `hostname` already exists; MAC already bound; Worker already has a disk for that (os, os_version) (duplicate version); IQN already exists on Agent; backing file already exists |
| `500` | dnsmasq reload failed; file write failure; other unexpected errors |
| `503` | Agent unreachable; docker.sock unavailable |

---

## 7.3 PUT /workers/{worker_id}/default-disk

### Description

**What the “default boot disk” is for**: a Worker can have multiple system disks (at most one per OS+version pair, e.g., `ubuntu 22.04` + `windows`; different versions of the same OS can coexist). On every boot, the iPXE menu auto-selects one item after its timeout — the default boot disk configured here decides which item is auto-selected, and also decides which disk’s connection info `/boot-vars` projects (`base_nqn` / `storager_ip` come from the default boot disk, see section 5). Without it, the menu auto-selects `reboot` with a 1 ms timeout and loops rebooting until the admin finishes configuration — never silently booting into the wrong OS.

**Note**: `disk` is not an OS name; it is the disk-level random identifier `os_tag` (generated at disk creation in 7.1, 12 hex chars, the data-plane unique key) — when multiple versions of the same OS coexist, only the os_tag can precisely locate the **specific disk** to boot by default.

The `/boot-vars` `menu_default` derivation chain:

```text
default_disk (the `disk` field of this endpoint, highest priority) -> boot.menu_default (the `menu_default` field of this endpoint) -> reboot (not configured, loop reboot waiting)
```

The three request body fields can be sent individually or in combination; at least one must be provided. Sending `null` (or an empty string) clears the corresponding item. This endpoint can be called repeatedly; later calls override earlier ones — they write the same ledger fields as the `boot` passed at registration (see 7.0).

Requirements:

- When setting `disk`: The Worker must already have a system disk with that `os_tag` (created by `POST /workers/{worker_id}/luns/disk`), otherwise a `400` is returned listing the current system disks. In the multi-disk model, use `os_tag` to precisely match the disk to boot by default.
- When setting `menu_default`: The value must be a valid item ID from the `menu.ipxe` main menu (strict validation to prevent an empty `choose --default` in iPXE); OS-semantics values (legacy OS names) are normalized to the generic OS item `boot-os`.
- When setting `menu_timeout`: Non-negative integer; `0` means the menu waits indefinitely (never auto-selects, waits for a human keypress); clearing restores the default `IPXE_CP_BOOT_MENU_TIMEOUT` (currently `5000`).

### Path Parameters

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|---|---:|---|
| `worker_id` | Yes | Worker identifier. |

### Request Body Fields

| Field | Required | Description |
|---|---:|---|
| `disk` | No | The `os_tag` (12 hex chars) of the default boot disk — precisely references a specific disk, and must match a disk already attached to this Worker. Pass `null` to clear. |
| `menu_default` | No | Default item on the iPXE main menu (auto-selected after the menu times out). See the valid values table below; case-insensitive (auto-lowercased). Pass `null` to clear. |
| `menu_timeout` | No | Menu timeout in milliseconds, non-negative integer; `0` means the menu waits indefinitely (never auto-selects, waits for a human keypress). Pass `null` to clear, restoring `IPXE_CP_BOOT_MENU_TIMEOUT` (currently `5000`). |

### Valid `menu_default` Values (menu.ipxe Main Menu Item IDs)

| Category | Valid Values |
|---|---|
| Generic OS item | `boot-os` (derived from the default disk configuration, not set manually here; legacy OS-semantics values normalize to it) |
| Tools / Installation | `menu-diag` `menu-install` |
| Advanced | `config` `shell` `reboot` `exit` |

### Example: Set Default Boot Disk

```bash
curl -s -X PUT "$BASE_URL/workers/worker-01/default-disk" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "disk": "0d26b6f33a89"
  }'
```

### Example: Set Menu Default Item and Timeout

```bash
curl -s -X PUT "$BASE_URL/workers/worker-win-build/default-disk" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "menu_default": "menu-install",
    "menu_timeout": 3000
  }'
```

### Example: Clear Default Boot Disk

```bash
curl -s -X PUT "$BASE_URL/workers/worker-01/default-disk" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "disk": null
  }'
```

### Success Response

Returns the full Worker inventory, including the set fields like `default_disk`, `boot.menu_default`, `boot.menu_timeout`.

### Common Errors

| HTTP Status | Common Causes |
|---:|---|
| `400` | None of the three fields provided; `disk` does not match any attached system disk; `menu_default` not in the valid values table; `menu_timeout` negative |
| `401` | Missing or incorrect Token |
| `404` | Worker not found |
| `409` | Setting `disk` when the Worker has no system disks |

---

## 7.4 DELETE /workers/{worker_id}/luns/disk/{os_tag}

### Description

Deletes a single system disk of a given Worker (by the disk-level random identifier `os_tag`, 12 hex chars). The Control Plane will:

1. Verify the Worker exists and has a disk with that `os_tag` (returns `404` if not).
2. Call the hosting Agent to delete the iSCSI target.
3. Remove the disk entry from the Worker’s `disks` array in `state/workers.yml`.
4. Cleanup linkage: if the deleted disk was the default boot disk (`default_disk` equals its `os_tag`), both `default_disk` and any matching (same-OS) `boot.menu_default` are cleared (to prevent iPXE from booting to a deleted disk).
5. When the last disk is deleted, `state` reverts from `ready` to `registered` (waiting for a new disk to be created).

### Query Parameters

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|---|---:|---|
| `delete_file` | `false` | Whether to also delete the backing `.img` file. `false` only deletes the target (the .img is retained and can be re-attached). |
| `ignore_missing_target` | `false` | If `true`, ignores a `404 iqn not found` from the Agent and continues with the inventory cleanup. |

### Example: Delete System Disk, Keep .img

```bash
curl -s -X DELETE "$BASE_URL/workers/worker-01/luns/disk/0d26b6f33a89" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

### Example: Delete System Disk and .img File

```bash
curl -s -X DELETE "$BASE_URL/workers/worker-01/luns/disk/0d26b6f33a89?delete_file=true" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

### Success Response

Returns the full Worker inventory (with `disks` no longer containing the deleted system disk; if it was the default, `default_disk`/`boot.menu_default` are cleared; if no disks remain, `state=registered`).

### Common Errors

| HTTP Status | Common Causes |
|---:|---|
| `400` | Invalid `os_tag` (not 12 hex chars) |
| `401` | Missing or incorrect Token |
| `404` | Worker not found, or the Worker does not have a disk with that `os_tag` |

---

## 7.6 POST /workers/batch

### Description

Bulk-creates Workers (**per-item independent** — a failure of one item does not affect the others; **idempotent** — re-running does not duplicate Workers). `worker_id`s are generated as `name_prefix` + an index (`worker-01`, `worker-02`, …; the index starts at `01` and its width adapts to `count` — `count=100` yields `worker-001` … `worker-100`).

- Without `macs` → all Workers are **idle** (hostname binding only, no device authorized); bind them later via `POST /devices/{mac}/bind` (16.7)
- With `macs` (must be the same length as `count`) → each MAC is validated against the device pool and bound directly (same semantics as passing `mac` in section 7: the device must be `state=pooled`; pool-miss / already bound → that item is `failed` and **not created**, retry after fixing)

`windows_iso` is not supported (register installation ISOs one by one via section 7).

### Request Body Fields

| Field | Required | Description |
|---|---:|---|
| `count` | Yes | Number of Workers to create, 1–100 |
| `name_prefix` | No | Worker ID prefix, default `worker-`. The generated `worker_id`s must be valid (letters, digits, dot, underscore, hyphen allowed); an invalid prefix rejects the whole batch with `400` |
| `macs` | No | Array of MAC addresses (format `00:0c:29:b9:8b:2d`); when provided, its length must equal `count`, and each MAC is validated and bound directly |
| `arch` | No | Architecture. Defaults to `x86_64` |
| `boot` | No | iPXE menu default and timeout config; fields as in section 7 |

### Idempotency and Failure Classification

- `succeeded`: created by this call (with `macs`: includes the bind — an item is only created after its bind succeeds)
- `skipped`: `worker_id` already exists (result of re-running the same request)
- `failed`: device not in pool / revoked / already bound / invalid MAC / hostname conflict etc. — the item is not created, the others are unaffected; retry after fixing

### Example

```bash
curl -s -X POST "$BASE_URL/workers/batch" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "count": 3,
    "name_prefix": "worker-",
    "macs": ["00:0c:29:b9:8b:01", "00:0c:29:b9:8b:02", "00:0c:29:b9:8b:03"]
  }'
```

### Success Response (200)

```json
{
  "succeeded": [
    {"worker_id": "worker-01", "hostname": "worker-01", "mac": "00:0c:29:b9:8b:01"}
  ],
  "skipped": [],
  "failed": [
    {
      "worker_id": "worker-02",
      "hostname": "worker-02",
      "mac": "00:0c:29:b9:8b:02",
      "error": "device already bound to worker-01: 00:0c:29:b9:8b:02"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Common Errors

| HTTP Status | Common Causes |
|---:|---|
| `400` | `name_prefix` empty / generated `worker_id` invalid / `macs` length not equal to `count` |
| `401` | Missing or incorrect Token |
| `422` | `count` missing or out of 1–100 range |

## 7.7 NVMe-oF Authentication Credentials (/workers/{worker_id}/credential)

### Description

The NVMe-oF connection authentication key store (key follows the Worker ruling, 2026-08-22):
keys are indexed by `worker_id`, and all devices bound to that Worker share the same key
(a rebind rotates the key). Keys use the **DHHC-1** format (blueprint 2.1 contract):
`DHHC-1:<two-digit type>:<base64(key + CRC32 little-endian 4 bytes)>`, with a 32-byte
(SHA-256) or 64-byte (SHA-512) key body.

After a credential write, the Control Plane **pushes the desired state to the Agent(s) hosting
the Worker’s system disks** (audited as `credential.push`, never logging the key itself). The
Agent relays to the storage node’s nvmet host service to register hosts (subsystem = disk,
named by the disk’s NQN — the NQN is the authoritative disk identifier, the IQN is derived
from it (`iqn.` + nqn[4:], e.g. `nqn.2026-07.com.controller:worker-01.ubuntu` →
`iqn.2026-07.com.controller:worker-01.ubuntu`);
IQNs are never used as subsystem NQNs (NVMe Base Spec §7.9 requires the `nqn.` prefix),
Host NQN derived from the bound device UUID as `nqn.2014-08.org.ipxe:<uuid>`; devices without
UUID fall back to the shared NQN `nqn.2014-08.org.ipxe:ipxe`). Push failures are audited but
never block the main flow (the Agent writes its cache first, and a periodic reconcile replays
the desired state).

Operations that trigger a push: setting/deleting credentials, device bind/unbind/rebind
(`PUT /workers/{worker_id}/mac`), disk create/delete (including batch), and Worker deletion.

### PUT /workers/{worker_id}/credential

Set or update the key (idempotent: setting the same value again leaves `updated_at` unchanged).

```bash
curl -X PUT "$BASE_URL/workers/worker-01/credential" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"secret": "DHHC-1:01:<base64>"}'
```

Success response:

```json
{
  "worker_id": "worker-01",
  "exists": true,
  "secret_hash": "sha256:1a2b3c4d5e6f",
  "created_at": "2026-08-22T08:00:00+00:00",
  "updated_at": "2026-08-22T08:00:00+00:00"
}
```

| HTTP Status | Common Causes |
|---:|---|
| `422` | DHHC-1 validation failed (prefix / digit-count of type / base64 / length 36 or 68 / CRC final value, any mismatch) |
| `404` | Worker not found |

### DELETE /workers/{worker_id}/credential

Delete the key (revokes the authentication for all devices bound to this Worker; the next boot
falls back to plaintext connections):

```bash
curl -X DELETE "$BASE_URL/workers/worker-01/credential" -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

Success returns `{"deleted": "worker-01"}`; missing Worker or entry → `404`.

### GET /workers/{worker_id}/credential

Query credential metadata (**never returns plaintext**; `secret_hash` only exposes a prefix
for rotation comparison):

```bash
curl -s "$BASE_URL/workers/worker-01/credential" -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

```json
{
  "worker_id": "worker-01",
  "exists": true,
  "secret_hash": "sha256:1a2b3c4d5e6f",
  "created_at": "2026-08-22T08:00:00+00:00",
  "updated_at": "2026-08-22T08:00:00+00:00"
}
```

When there is no entry, `exists=false` and `secret_hash` is absent.

## 11. DELETE /workers/{worker_id}

### Description

Deletes a Worker. The Control Plane will:

1. Look up the Worker’s disk and CD inventory from `workers.yml`.
2. **Cascade-unbind devices**: every device whose `bound_worker_id` is this Worker is released back to the pool (`state=pooled`, `bound_worker_id=null`; the devices are **not** revoked) — the unbind is persisted first, and if it fails the deletion is aborted.
3. If a CD target exists, delete it first.
4. Then delete the disk target(s).
5. Remove the Worker from `workers.yml`.
6. Remove the `mac,hostname` line from `dnsmasq/dhcp-hosts.conf`.
7. Send HUP to `ipxe-dnsmasq`.

The same cascade-unbind applies to `POST /workers/delete/batch` (11.1).

### Path Parameters

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|---|---:|---|
| `worker_id` | Yes | Worker identifier to delete. |

### Query Parameters

| Parameter | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---:|---|---|
| `delete_disk` | No | `false` | Whether to also delete backing `.img` files. |
| `ignore_missing_target` | No | `false` | If `true`, ignores `404 iqn not found` from the Agent and continues. |

### curl

Delete only targets, keep `.img` files:

```bash
curl -s -X DELETE "$BASE_URL/workers/worker-01?delete_disk=false" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

Delete targets and `.img` files:

```bash
curl -s -X DELETE "$BASE_URL/workers/worker-01?delete_disk=true" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

Ignore missing targets on the Agent:

```bash
curl -s -X DELETE "$BASE_URL/workers/worker-01?delete_disk=true&ignore_missing_target=true" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

### Example Success Response

```json
{
  "deleted": "worker-01",
  "delete_disk": false,
  "dnsmasq_removed": true
}
```

---

## 11.1 POST /workers/delete/batch

### Description

Batch delete Workers. Each item is processed independently; **a failure of one does not affect the others**. Returns a summary of `succeeded` / `failed`. The processing per Worker is identical to the single deletion in section 11 (delete CD/system disk targets → remove from inventory → remove dnsmasq binding). After all successful items are processed, the inventory is saved and dnsmasq is reloaded **only once**. Non-existent Workers are counted as `failed` (`worker not found`).

### Request Body Fields

| Field | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---:|---|---|
| `worker_ids` | Yes | — | Array of Worker identifiers to delete. |
| `delete_disk` | No | `false` | Whether to also delete backing `.img` files. |
| `ignore_missing_target` | No | `false` | If `true`, ignores `404 iqn not found` from the Agent and continues. |

### curl

```bash
curl -s -X POST "$BASE_URL/workers/delete/batch" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "worker_ids": ["worker-01", "worker-02"],
    "delete_disk": false,
    "ignore_missing_target": true
  }'
```

### Example Success Response

```json
{
  "succeeded": [
    {"worker_id": "worker-01", "hostname": "worker-01"}
  ],
  "failed": [
    {"worker_id": "worker-03", "error": "worker not found: worker-03"}
  ]
}
```

## 12. GET /operations

### Description

Reads the Control Plane operation audit log. This file is an incremental query interface over `state/operations.jsonl`.

### Query Parameters

| Parameter | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---:|---|---|
| `since` | No | `0` | Only return records with `id > since`. |
| `limit` | No | `1000` | Maximum number of records to return. |
| `mac` | No | — | Only return operations of this device (MAC, normalized then filtered by the `mac` field); used for viewing device binding history. |

### curl

Read from the beginning:

```bash
curl -s "$BASE_URL/operations" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

Incremental read:

```bash
curl -s "$BASE_URL/operations?since=10&limit=100" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

### Example Success Response

```json
{
  "next_cursor": 5,
  "entries": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "ts": "2026-07-27T14:20:00+00:00",
      "op": "create_worker",
      "status": "started",
      "worker_id": "worker-01",
      "client": "172.18.0.1"
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "ts": "2026-07-27T14:20:01+00:00",
      "op": "agent.create_disk",
      "status": "ok",

      "agent": "storage-lio-01",
      "iqn": "iqn.2026-07.com.controller:worker-01.ubuntu"
    }
  ]
}
```

## 13. Typical Test Sequence

It is recommended to verify in this order:

### 13.1 Check Service Liveness

```bash
curl -s "$BASE_URL/healthz"
```

### 13.2 Check Boot Variable Projection

```bash
curl -s "$BASE_URL/boot-vars?mac=000c29b98b2d&hostname=worker-01"
curl -s "$BASE_URL/boot-vars?mac=000c29b98b2d&hostname=worker-01&format=json"
```

### 13.3 Check Agent Configuration and Capabilities

Note: `config/agents.yml` is read from inside the Control Plane container. If an Agent is on the same host as the Control Plane, you cannot use `http://localhost:4840` because `localhost` inside the container points to the Control Plane container itself.

The default Compose file already configures:

```yaml
extra_hosts:
  - "host.docker.internal:host-gateway"
```

Therefore, for an Agent on the same host, configure it as:

```yaml
base_url: http://host.docker.internal:4840
```

```bash
curl -s "$BASE_URL/agents?live=true" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

### 13.4 Register Worker Identity (hostname + MAC binding)

```bash
curl -s -X POST "$BASE_URL/workers" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "worker_id": "worker-00",
    "mac": "00:0c:29:b9:8b:00"
  }'
```

At this point, the Worker is MAC-bound but has no system disk (`state=registered`, `disks` is an empty array).

### 13.5 Create a System Disk for worker-00 (empty disk)

```bash
curl -s -X POST "$BASE_URL/workers/worker-00/luns/disk" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "type": "empty",
    "os": "ubuntu",
    "size": "40G"
  }'
```

After the disk is created, `state` transitions from `registered` to `ready`.

### 13.6 Set Default Boot Configuration

```bash
# disk = the os_tag returned by disk creation in 13.5 (12 hex chars, precisely references a specific disk)
curl -s -X PUT "$BASE_URL/workers/worker-00/default-disk" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "disk": "0d26b6f33a89"
  }'
```

`/boot-vars` will now return `menu-default=boot-os` (2026-08-30 MAIN MENU dynamicization: the OS item has converged to a single generic item). See section 7.3 for examples of setting menu items and timeout.

### 13.7 Query Worker Inventory

```bash
curl -s "$BASE_URL/workers/worker-00" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

### 13.8 Query Real-Time Status

```bash
curl -s "$BASE_URL/workers/worker-00/status" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

### 13.9 Delete Worker, Keeping the Empty Disk File

```bash
curl -s -X DELETE "$BASE_URL/workers/worker-00?delete_disk=false" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

This step is ideal for a workflow where you create an empty disk, then manually rename it to a master image.

## 14. Agent iSCSI LUN/Target Management

### Description

The Control Plane can directly manage iSCSI targets/LUNs on any Agent. Requests are forwarded by the Control Plane to the Agent over mTLS (the Control Plane’s component client certificate, bound to the internal CA — K8S-style), so callers only need the Control Plane Token and never need to contact the Agent directly.

Differences from Worker lifecycle endpoints (`POST /workers`, `DELETE /workers/{worker_id}`):

- Worker endpoints are **inventory-oriented**: they automatically assemble IQNs, write `state/workers.yml`, and write dnsmasq bindings.
- LUN management endpoints are **data-plane direct management**: they do not write any inventory; they directly operate targets on the Agent. Suitable for master image management, manual troubleshooting, temporary ISO mounting, etc.

All endpoints require authentication (`IPXE_CP_TOKEN`). If the Agent is not found, `404 agent not found` is returned. If the Agent is unreachable, `503` is returned. Business validation errors from the Agent side (e.g., IQN prefix mismatch, file already exists, IQN already exists) are passed through with the Agent’s status code and `detail`:

```json
{"agent": "storage-lio-01", "error": "iqn base mismatch: ..."}
```

### 14.1 GET /agents/{agent_id}/luns

Lists all iSCSI targets/LUNs on the specified Agent. The response structure depends on the Agent backend (stgt includes a `tid` field, LIO is the parsed output of `targetcli`). The Control Plane passes it through unchanged.

#### Path Parameters

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|---|---:|---|
| `agent_id` | Yes | Agent identifier, corresponding to a key in `config/agents.yml`. |

#### curl

```bash
curl -s "$BASE_URL/agents/storage-lio-01/luns" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

#### Example Success Response

```json
[
  {
    "iqn": "iqn.2026-07.com.controller:worker-01.ubuntu",
    "luns": [
      {
        "backing": "/home/iscsi_img/worker-01.ubuntu.img"
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

### 14.2 POST /agents/{agent_id}/luns/disk

Creates a disk LUN on the specified Agent. Pass `master` to clone from a master image (prefers btrfs / ZFS(≥2.2) reflink for instant cloning), or pass `size` to create an empty sparse disk. If the Agent is not configured with `role.disk`, it returns `400 agent ... not configured for disk role`.

#### Path Parameters

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|---|---:|---|
| `agent_id` | Yes | Agent identifier. |

#### Request Body Fields

| Field | Required | Description |
|---|---:|---|
| `iqn` | Yes | Target IQN (the derived form of the disk NQN). Must be prefixed with the Agent’s IQN base (derived from `IPXE_NQN_BASE`). |
| `filename` | No | Backing filename. If omitted, the Agent auto-generates one from the IQN. |
| `master` | Conditionally required | Master image filename (located in `DISK_DIR`). Mutually exclusive with `size`. |
| `size` | Conditionally required | Empty disk size, e.g., `40G`. Mutually exclusive with `master`. |

#### curl

```bash
# Clone from master
curl -s -X POST "$BASE_URL/agents/storage-lio-01/luns/disk" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "iqn": "iqn.2026-07.com.controller:worker-02.ubuntu",
    "master": "_tpl_ubuntu_2204.img"
  }'

# Create empty disk
curl -s -X POST "$BASE_URL/agents/storage-lio-01/luns/disk" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "iqn": "iqn.2026-07.com.controller:worker-02.ubuntu",
    "filename": "worker-02.ubuntu.img",
    "size": "40G"
  }'
```

#### Example Success Response

```json
{
  "iqn": "iqn.2026-07.com.controller:worker-02.ubuntu",
  "backing": "/home/iscsi_img/worker-02.ubuntu.img"
}
```

### 14.3 POST /agents/{agent_id}/luns/cd

Creates a CD (ISO virtual drive) LUN on the specified Agent. Only Agents with `role.cd` set to true support this. If the Agent is not configured for the CD role (e.g., LIO), it returns `400 agent ... not configured for cd role`. Backend capability limitations are passed through from the Agent.

#### Request Body Fields

| Field | Required | Description |
|---|---:|---|
| `iso` | Yes | ISO filename (present in `DISK_DIR`). |
| `iqn` | No | Target IQN. If omitted, the Agent auto-generates one from the derived IQN base (from `IPXE_NQN_BASE`):`iso_filename`. |

#### curl

```bash
curl -s -X POST "$BASE_URL/agents/controller-stgt/luns/cd" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "iso": "Win11_24H2.iso"
  }'
```

### 14.4 DELETE /agents/{agent_id}/luns

Deletes a LUN/target on the specified Agent.

#### Query Parameters

| Parameter | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---:|---|---|
| `iqn` | Yes | None | Target IQN to delete. |
| `delete_file` | No | `false` | Whether to also delete the backing file (`.img`/`.iso`). |
| `ignore_missing` | No | `false` | If `true`, treats a `404 iqn not found` from the Agent as success. |

#### curl

```bash
# Delete only the target, keep the backing file
curl -s -X DELETE "$BASE_URL/agents/storage-lio-01/luns?iqn=iqn.2026-07.com.controller:worker-02.ubuntu" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"

# Delete target and backing file, continue even if target was already missing
curl -s -X DELETE "$BASE_URL/agents/storage-lio-01/luns?iqn=iqn.2026-07.com.controller:worker-02.ubuntu&delete_file=true&ignore_missing=true" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

#### Example Success Response

```json
{
  "deleted": "iqn.2026-07.com.controller:worker-02.ubuntu",
  "delete_file": false
}
```

When ignoring a missing target:

```json
{
  "deleted": "iqn.2026-07.com.controller:worker-02.ubuntu",
  "delete_file": true,
  "ignored_missing": true
}
```

### 14.5 POST /agents/{agent_id}/luns/scan

Triggers the Agent to scan its image directory and rebuild targets for missing `.img`/`.iso` files (file-is-truth). For stgt backends, the result includes what was recreated. For LIO backends, due to `saveconfig` persistence, it usually skips everything.

#### curl

```bash
curl -s -X POST "$BASE_URL/agents/storage-lio-01/luns/scan" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

#### Example Success Response

```json
{
  "created": [
    {
      "iqn": "iqn.2026-07.com.controller:worker-02.ubuntu",
      "cd": false
    }
  ],
  "skipped": []
}
```

---

## 15. GET /masters (Master Image List)

### Description

Aggregates and lists the master images from all **enabled disk-role** Agents (`enabled=true` and `role.disk=true`). Master images are identified by the storage Agent’s background scanning thread (every 30 seconds by default), which looks for image files in `DISK_DIR` whose names contain the `_tpl_` marker (e.g., `_tpl_ubuntu_2204.img`).

Used by the WebUI for the master clone drop-down list. **It has no linkage to Worker creation APIs** — purely a read-only query, does not change any state or write inventory.

### Failure Tolerance

- A single Agent unreachable or authentication failure: that node returns an `error` field and logs an audit `master.list` (failed), **but does not block the overall result**.
- All nodes fail: the overall response is `502`.
- Partial success / no available nodes: returns `200` (with an empty `agents` array if no nodes).

### curl

```bash
curl -s "$BASE_URL/masters" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

### Example Success Response

```json
{
  "agents": [
    {
      "agent": "storage-lio-01",
      "storager_ip": "192.168.80.3",
      "masters": [
        {"name": "_tpl_ubuntu_2204.img", "size": 10737418240, "mtime": 1785643200},
        {"name": "_tpl_debian_12.img", "size": 8589934592, "mtime": 1785729600}
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `agents` | Array, one entry per Agent with the disk role enabled. |
| `agents[].agent` | Agent identifier (key in `config/agents.yml`). |
| `agents[].storager_ip` | Data-plane address (same fallback rule as `/boot-vars`). |
| `agents[].masters` | Array of masters, each `{name, size, mtime}`: filename / size in bytes / modification timestamp. |
| `agents[].error` | Error details if querying this node failed (absent for successful nodes). |

---

## 16. Device Pool (Device Inventory)

The device inventory (`state/devices.yml`) is the bottom-layer entity of the three-layer entity model (device / Worker / system disk): auto-registration and manual import only enter the device pool — **registration ≠ authorization**: a device only gains an identity after being bound to a Worker. The binding relationship is authoritative on the device side (`bound_worker_id`); the Worker side only projects it and does not store it.

**Binding semantics (P2)**: device ↔ Worker is strictly **one-to-one**. A device binds via `POST /devices/{mac}/bind` (16.7); `force=true` performs an atomic rebind (pre-check → new binding persisted → old binding cleared → rollback on failure). Unbinding (`DELETE /devices/{mac}/bind`, 16.8) returns the device to the pool; the Worker's system disks are kept. Deleting a Worker cascades an unbind (11). `POST /workers` with a `mac` also binds directly (7).

**Readiness projection**: Worker responses (list / detail / status) derive two fields from the ledger:

- `bound_device`: the MAC of the device bound to this Worker (`null` if none)
- `readiness`: `ready` (bound device + at least one system disk) / `partial` (bound device **or** system disk) / `idle` (neither)

### Device States

| State | Description |
|---|---|
| `pooled` | In the device pool, unbound (window-enrolled / manually registered / bulk imported) |
| `bound` | Bound to a Worker (one-to-one); see `bound_worker_id` |
| `revoked` | Revoked; no longer accepts reports and cannot be re-registered |

### Record Structure (Example)

```yaml
devices:
  "00:0c:29:b9:8b:2d":
    mac: 00:0c:29:b9:8b:2d
    uuid: "4c4c4544-..."          # SMBIOS UUID (dual factor, optional)
    state: pooled                 # pooled | bound | revoked
    bound_worker_id: null         # authoritative here; worker side only projects
    key_hash: null                # filled in the security blueprint phase; empty for now
    source: ipxe                  # ipxe (auto) | manual (manual entry/import)
    fingerprint:                  # reported values; updated by device reports
      manufacturer: ASUSTeK COMPUTER INC.
      product: ROG Zephyrus G15
      serial: "..."
      cpumodel: "Intel(R) Core(TM) Ultra 7 155H"
      mem_total: 32768            # normalized decimal (accepts 0x hex reports)
      mem_type: DDR5
      mem_speed: 5600
      chip: RTL8125
      busid: "0110ec8125"
    first_seen: 2026-08-15T10:00:00+08:00
    last_seen: 2026-08-15T12:00:00+08:00
```

### 16.1 GET /devices

Device pool list with `state` filtering (`all` / `pooled` / `bound` / `revoked`, default `all`).

**curl**:

```bash
curl http://<host>:4839/devices?state=pooled \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $CP_TOKEN"
```

**Successful response**: an array; each item is a device record (see “Record Structure” above).

### 16.2 GET /devices/{mac}

Single device detail (bound Worker, fingerprint, first/last report). `mac` uses the colon format (`00:0c:29:b9:8b:2d`).

**404**: device not found.

### 16.3 POST /devices

Manually register a device: MAC (+ optional UUID / manufacturer / product / serial) into the pool.

**Request body**:

| Field | Required | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `mac` | Yes | str | MAC address |
| `uuid` | No | str | SMBIOS UUID (dual factor, optional) |
| `manufacturer` / `product` / `serial` | No | str | Reported info; initial inventory values only, superseded by device reports |

**Successful response (201)**: device record (`state=pooled`, `source=manual`).

**409**: device already exists (including revoked — revoked devices cannot be re-registered).

### 16.4 POST /devices/import

Bulk import a device manifest (pre-import of the MAC manifest): each entry is independent; duplicates are skipped; invalid/revoked entries count as `failed`.

**Request body**:

| Field | Required | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `entries` | Yes | array | Manifest array; each entry follows the 16.3 request body (`mac` required) |

**Successful response**:

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `created` | MACs newly added to the pool |
| `skipped` | Already existing (pooled/bound) entries and reasons |
| `failed` | Invalid MAC / revoked entries and reasons |

### 16.5 DELETE /devices/{mac}

Revoke a device: `pooled` → `revoked`; the record stays in the inventory (audit retention).

**409**: device is bound to a Worker (must unbind first) or already revoked.

### 16.6 GET /devices/report

iPXE device info reporting endpoint (**no auth**; `boot.ipxe.cfg` chains it before `/boot-vars`): updates the fingerprint + `last_seen`; an unknown MAC enters the pool only while the registration window is open and a valid public key is carried. **Returns an empty script body** (`#!ipxe\n`; consumable directly by `chain`, no script side effects; an empty body is reported as EOF by some iPXE builds, so a legal empty script is returned uniformly).

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `mac` | Yes | MAC; accepts colon format (`${mac}`) and compact hex (`${netX/mac}`) |
| `uuid` / `manufacturer` / `product` / `serial` / `cpumodel` / `mem-type` / `chip` / `busid` | No | String fields; empty values tolerated |
| `mem-total` / `mem-speed` | No | Integer; accepts `0x` hex and decimal; stored normalized as decimal |
| `pubkey` | No | ECDSA P-256 public key (130-hex uncompressed point), used for enrollment/claim; absent or invalid → ignored |

Behavior:

- Registered device: updates the fingerprint (non-empty fields overwrite) + `last_seen`; `state` unchanged; while the window is open, a valid public key fills in `key_hash` (key claim); a key mismatch is rejected (only audited as `device.claim rejected`)
- Revoked device: ignored (not updated, not resurrected)
- Unknown MAC + window open + valid public key: enters the pool (`state=pooled`, `key_hash` filled, `source=ipxe`)
- Unknown MAC + window closed / no public key: fingerprint only, no pool entry (enrollment only during the window, see 5.1)

**curl** (simulating an iPXE report):

```bash
curl "http://<host>:4839/devices/report?mac=000c29b98b2d&uuid=4c4c4544-...&manufacturer=ASUSTeK%20COMPUTER%20INC.&product=ROG%20Zephyrus%20G15&cpumodel=Intel(R)%20Core(TM)%20Ultra%207%20155H&mem-total=0x8000&mem-type=DDR5&mem-speed=5600&chip=RTL8125&busid=0110ec8125"

### 16.7 POST /devices/{mac}/bind

Binds a device to a Worker (one-to-one authorization). **409** by default when the device or the Worker is already bound; `force=true` performs an **atomic rebind**: pre-check → new binding persisted → old binding cleared (old device back to the pool) → on failure the ledger snapshot is restored and dnsmasq is best-effort restored (see “Implementation Boundaries”, §17). Idempotent: re-binding the same device to the same Worker returns `200` without changes.

| Query Parameter | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---:|---|---|
| `worker_id` | Yes | — | Target Worker. |
| `force` | No | `false` | Atomic rebind when device or Worker is already bound. |

**404**: device or Worker not found. **409**: device revoked / already bound (without `force`) / Worker already bound (without `force`) / dnsmasq conflict.

Rebind scenarios with `force=true`:

- Device bound to `worker-01`, rebind to `worker-02` → device moves; `worker-01` becomes idle (no device)
- `worker-02` also bound another device → that device is released back to the pool
- Device already bound to `worker-02` and `worker-02` bound to this device → idempotent success

The audit trail records `device.bind` with `old_worker_id` / `old_device_mac` (rebind history).

**curl**:

```bash
curl -X POST "http://<host>:4839/devices/00:0c:29:b9:8b:2d/bind?worker_id=worker-01&force=false" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $CP_TOKEN"
```

**Successful response (200)**: the device record (`state=bound`, `bound_worker_id=worker-01`).

### 16.8 DELETE /devices/{mac}/bind

Unbinds a device: back to the pool (`state=pooled`, `bound_worker_id=null`), the dnsmasq binding is removed and reloaded; the Worker's system disks are kept (its `readiness` degrades to `partial`/`idle`).

**409**: device not bound. **404**: device not found.

**curl**:

```bash
curl -X DELETE "http://<host>:4839/devices/00:0c:29:b9:8b:2d/bind" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $CP_TOKEN"
```

### 16.9 POST /devices/bind/batch/preview

Bulk bind **preview** (read-only, no writes): pairs the manifest into a pairing table.

**Request body**:

| Field | Required | Description |
|---|---:|---|
| `mode` | No | `manifest` (default): use `pairs`; `sequential`: pair `macs[i]` ↔ `worker_ids[i]` by index (lengths must match, otherwise `400`). |
| `pairs` | No | Array of `{mac, worker_id, manufacturer?, product?, serial?, uuid?}`; the optional fields are **declaration columns** compared against the reported fingerprint (see below). |
| `macs` / `worker_ids` | No | Used by `mode=sequential`. |

Classification per entry (independent, no whole-batch rejection):

- `matched`: device pooled + Worker exists + Worker unbound (includes `device_state`, `worker_state`, `fingerprint_mismatch`)
- `conflicts`: device already bound / Worker already bound / duplicate MAC in manifest / Worker not found
- `not_found`: device out of pool (`device not in pool`), revoked, or invalid MAC

`fingerprint_mismatch` is `null` when consistent; otherwise `{"fields": ["serial", ...]}` — declaration values that differ from reported values (both non-empty). It is advisory and does not block binding.

**Successful response**: `{matched: [...], conflicts: [...], not_found: [...], summary: {total, ok, conflict, not_found}}`.

### 16.10 POST /devices/bind/batch

Bulk bind **execution** (idempotent, per-entry independent; failures of one entry do not affect the rest). Same request body as 16.9. Classification:

- `succeeded`: bound now (with `fingerprint_mismatch` marker if declared values differ)
- `skipped`: already bound (same Worker) / device already bound to another Worker / Worker already bound / duplicate MAC in manifest
- `failed`: device not found (out-of-pool — import first via 16.3/16.4) / invalid MAC

**Audit**: besides the `device.bind.batch` summary, every `succeeded` entry also records a per-device `device.bind` (`mac` / `worker_id`), keeping device binding history (`GET /operations?mac=`) complete; `skipped` / `failed` are only counted in the summary.

**Successful response**: `{succeeded: [...], skipped: [...], failed: [...]}`. Re-running an already-completed manifest returns everything as `skipped`.

**curl**:

```bash
curl -X POST "http://<host>:4839/devices/bind/batch" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $CP_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"mode":"manifest","pairs":[{"mac":"00:0c:29:b9:8b:2d","worker_id":"worker-01"}]}'
```

## 17. Current Implementation Boundaries

The current version supports:

- Worker identity registration (hostname binding; `mac` optional — providing it binds the device directly)
- Bulk Worker creation (count + naming rule, optional `macs` direct bind, `POST /workers/batch`, 7.6)
- Device inventory (auto pool entry / manual registration / bulk import / revoke, `/devices` endpoints)
- Device↔Worker one-to-one binding (bind / force rebind / unbind / batch bind preview + execution, 16.7–16.10)
- Worker `mac` rebind mapping (`PUT /workers/{worker_id}/mac`, 7)
- Cascade unbind on Worker deletion (11 / 11.1)
- Boot-vars anti-impersonation (binding as authentication, 5)
- iPXE device info reporting (11-field fingerprint, `GET /devices/report`; auto-registration only enters the pool, no Worker creation)
- Worker system disk creation (`POST /workers/{worker_id}/luns/disk`)
- Setting Worker default boot configuration (default disk / menu item / timeout, `PUT /workers/{worker_id}/default-disk`)
- Worker deletion
- Agent selection
- Agent LUN direct management (list / create disk / create CD / delete / scan)
- Master image list query (`GET /masters`, backed by periodic background scanning on storage nodes)
- Master tag registration (os / os_version annotations, `PUT/DELETE /agents/{agent_id}/masters/{master_name}/tag`, 6.4; aggregated and merged in `/masters`)
- Windows ISO special handling
- dnsmasq hostname bindings
- Worker and operation audit trail queries
- Multi-OS system disks (a Worker can have disks for multiple OSes: at most one per (os, os_version), different versions can coexist, distinguished by the disk-level `os_tag`, with `default_disk` determining the default boot)
- NVMe-oF authentication key store (DHHC-1, key follows Worker, 7.7; `/boot-vars` injects `nbft_secret`, 5)
- Credential push driver (pushes to Agents on credential set/revoke, device bind/unbind/rebind, disk create/delete, Worker deletion; the Agent relays to the nvmet host service to sync the hosts matrix)

The current version does **not** yet include:

- Automatic IP management
- Automatic master image lifecycle management
- Scheduled reconciliation
- Data disk attachment (the `/luns/data` namespace is reserved)
- Real transactions for the file-based storage: rollback = rewrite; if a rebind's old-binding cleanup fails **and** the restore also fails, locate and fix manually via the audit trail (16.7)
