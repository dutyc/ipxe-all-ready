> The Way flows through the six empty lines, above and below without constancy; the firm and the yielding interchange — it adapts to whatever change may come. — the I Ching · Great Commentary (Xici), Part II

Kurrent (周流, zhōuliú — "circling flow") is a cloud-native, stateless bare-metal delivery platform: as Kubernetes makes applications cloud-native, Kurrent makes compute cloud-native — compute is no longer bound to hardware; like an electric current, it flows across bare-metal servers and takes whatever form the moment demands.

## Features

- **Stateless compute** — compute nodes hold zero persistent state; plug in and boot.
- **Plug-and-play** — auto-joins the pool at boot; delivered from the Web UI in one click.
- **K8s-aligned** — declarative configuration and a CLI matching kubeadm / kubectl.
- **Dual data plane** — NVMe-oF and iSCSI; storage scales out horizontally.
